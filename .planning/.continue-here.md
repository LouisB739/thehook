<current_state>
Resume `/gsd:new-project` from Step 6 (Research Decision).
Steps 1-5 are complete. Config exists with saved defaults applied.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Step 1 (Setup): init completed, greenfield, git initialized
- Step 2 (Brownfield): skipped, no existing code
- Step 3 (Deep Questioning): Done via brainstorming — full design validated
- Step 4 (PROJECT.md): Written and committed
- Step 5 (Workflow Preferences): Config exists from /gsd:settings + defaults saved
- Design doc: `docs/plans/2026-02-23-thehook-mvp-design.md`
- Implementation plan: `docs/plans/2026-02-23-thehook-implementation-plan.md` (11 tasks, ~41 tests)
- Config: balanced profile, research on, plan_check on, verifier on, nyquist on, milestone branching
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Step 6: Research — spawn 4 parallel researchers (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) + synthesizer
- Step 7: Requirements — scope features, create REQUIREMENTS.md with REQ-IDs
- Step 8: Roadmap — spawn roadmapper, create ROADMAP.md + STATE.md
- Step 9: Done — present summary, route to /gsd:plan-phase 1
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Python 3.11+ with Click, ChromaDB, PyYAML, pytest
- CLI headless (claude -p / cursor-agent -p) as LLM engine
- Markdown source of truth + ChromaDB disposable search index
- Per-project `.thehook/` directory
- Auto-consolidation every N sessions (default 5)
- Claude Code hooks (SessionEnd for capture, SessionStart for retrieval)
- 3 extraction types: summaries, conventions, ADRs
- Configurable retrieval: auto-inject + manual /recall
- Models: balanced (Sonnet for most agents)
- Git branching: per milestone
</decisions_made>

<context>
TheHook = self-improving long-term memory for AI coding agents (Claude Code + Cursor).
Domain: developer tools, CLI tools, RAG systems, Claude Code hooks integration.
Researcher models: sonnet. Synthesizer: sonnet. Roadmapper: sonnet.
The design doc has full architecture details the researchers can reference.
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:new-project` picking up at Step 6 (Research Decision).
The workflow should:
1. Ask research decision (recommend yes)
2. Spawn 4 parallel researchers for: stack, features, architecture, pitfalls
3. Spawn synthesizer after researchers complete
4. Proceed to Step 7 (Requirements) then Step 8 (Roadmap)
